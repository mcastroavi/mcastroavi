- âš¡ Fun fact: I taught myself how to swim when I was 8 years old by jumping into a random lake in my native hometown.
      With zero experience about swimming and no adults around me, I decided to go from point a to point b through the water.
      I was afraid but I moved my hands so fast and kicked the water many times to get the other corner of the lake. 
      A valuable lesson about commitment. Just diving in and getting it done.
